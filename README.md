# Cafe-Menu 

This is my second project, built by following freeCodeCamp's step-by-step HTML & CSS tutorial.

From this, I learned:
- How to structure semantic HTML using elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`
- Linking external CSS to style HTML pages
- Using CSS properties like `color`, `text-align`, `margin`, and `padding`
- Organizing content into clean sections like headers and menus

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of basic HTML and CSS layout styling.

 Tech used: HTML, CSS
